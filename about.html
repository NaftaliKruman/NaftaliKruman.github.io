            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I grew up in New Jersey as a middle child. In a household characterized by spirited debates, I learned to balance different personalities and always consider other perspectives. Our home was filled with books and fostered a desire to always know more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a teen, I explored my curiosity through my studies and was encouraged to think broadly about my role within my community. After participating in a hurricane relief mission, I felt inspired to use my talents to help others. However, decision-making remained a challenge for me, and I struggled with committing to both mundane choices and major life decisions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thankfully, I enrolled at Brandeis University and took an economics course on a whim. There, I encountered a radically different approach to thinking that considers every nuance and its potential consequences. I fell in love with economics because of its rigorous approach to decision-making and its ability to drive social impact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now that I've graduated, I bring my passion for economics and social impact into my work. I use my analytical skills to drive meaningful change, no matter how big or small. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naftalikruman/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to chat about economics, my work, or how I can help!</p>
